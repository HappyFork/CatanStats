# CatanStats
 A program I made to keep track of my friends' stats in Settlers of Catan

I made this circa 2015 because my friends and I get very competative when playing Settlers of Catan. It runs in the terminal because I didn't know what I was doing.

The real code is in /src

I know now that Serialization is probably not the best method of saving and loading data. This was 7 years ago. Believe me.
